You are extracting grant/funding opportunity information from a foundation webpage or PDF text.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact top-level structure:

{
  "is_funding_related": true/false,
  "opportunities": [
    {
      "opportunity_name": "...",
      "opportunity_url": "... or empty string",
      "opportunity_type": "research|education|QI|fellowship|travel|other|unclear",
      "eligibility_us": "yes|no|unclear",
      "eligibility_text": "... short excerpt or summary ...",
      "deadline_text": "... short excerpt or summary ...",
      "award_amount_text": "... short excerpt or summary ...",
      "keywords_phrases": ["...", "...", "..."],
      "summary_1_2_sentences": "...",
      "evidence_snippets": ["...", "..."],
      "confidence": "low|med|high"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- If the page is not about funding opportunities, set is_funding_related=false and return an empty opportunities list.
- Many pages may describe multiple distinct opportunities; create one object per opportunity.
- Do NOT invent deadlines or dollar amounts. If missing, use empty string.
- eligibility_us should be:
  - "yes" if clearly open to US applicants or no geographic restrictions mentioned,
  - "no" if restricted to a different country/state/region that excludes Utah,
  - "unclear" if you cannot tell.
- keywords_phrases should include topic areas, target populations, methods, and career stage phrases (e.g., "early career", "pilot funding", "implementation science", disease/condition names).
- evidence_snippets must be short direct quotes from the text (max ~25 words each).
